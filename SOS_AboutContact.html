			<p><strong>Stacks O' Servers</strong> is the 743rd best reseller
				of enterprise grade network infrastructure devices. How do we have so nmany and such a wide variety? 
				That's a good question, and like all good questions, you should direct it towards our PR department: (<a href="tel:+16128730055">(612) 873-0055</a>)</p>
		   
			<p>This company was founded by the legendary Colonel Serverbeard (please note that Colonel is just a nickname)!
			   The Colonel has worked with many famous companies as a network engineer; such as Microsoft and Google. Over the course of his long career, the Colonel had
			   become dissatisfied with the options for buying networking hardware. It seemed to him that you could buy directly from the manufacturer if you hate having money,
			   or you could roll the dice and grab a used device from ebay. Neither option was appealing to the Colonel so he decided to start this company.</p>
			   
			<p>Stacks O' Servers is dedicated to a middle-man role: buying, testing, and refurbishing used server equipment in order to provide customers with guaranteed fully
			   functioning network devices</p>
